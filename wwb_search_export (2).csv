Hello, Robot.: Design between Human and Machine investigates how robotics is becoming part of our everyday lives, demonstrating that design in its traditional function as a mediator is indispensable if robots are to become a visible reality and not just remain hidden in washing machines, cars and cash machines. The volume clarifies where we already encounter these intelligent machines and where we may come across them in the near future: in industry, in the military and in everyday settings; at nurseries and retirement homes; in our bodies and in the cloud; when shopping and having sex; in video games and, of course, in film and literature. In a series of in-depth essays and interviews, experts such as the science-fiction author Bruce Sterling, novelist Douglas Coupland, architect Philip Beesley, and the design duo Dunne & Raby explore the question of how we deal with our environment becoming increasingly digital, smarter and more autonomous. They highlight our often ambivalent relationship to new technologies and discuss the opportunities and challenges that are posed to us as individuals and as a society in this context.","HELLO ROBOT DESIGN BETWEEN HUMAN AND MACHINE","Kries, Mateo","English"

In 18th-century Europe, while the old order reveled in the luxurious excesses of the Rococo style and the Enlightenment sowed the seeds of revolution, the shapeshifting libertine Giacomo Casanova seduced his way across the continent. Although notorious for the scores of amorous conquests he recorded in his remarkably frank memoirs, Casanova was just as practiced at charming his way into the most elite social circles, through an inimitable mix of literary ambition, improvisational genius and outright fraud. In his travels across Europe and through every level of society from the theatrical demimonde to royal courts, he was also seduced by the visual splendors he encountered. This volume accompanies the first major art exhibition outside Europe to lavishly recreate Casanova's visual world, from his birthplace of Venice, city of masquerades, to the cultural capitals of Paris and London and the outposts of Eastern Europe.","CASANOVA THE SEDUCTION OF EUROPE","Ilchman, Frederick","English"

One of the oldest settlements in Bangladesh, it is today among the largest cities in the world, and rapid, often unplanned, urbanization has vastly outpaced sustainability, threatening the historic buildings and communities that make up the city's cultural soul. But, despite bursting at the seams, Dhaka's six centuries of history are still visible if we are to look carefully in the shadows of the tall buildings, in the spaces between the speeding cars. Dhaka-based architect Kashef Chowdhury's camera captures a record of the capital city -- of the local character that may soon be lost due to urban development. In Chowdhury's photographs, a woman hangs sheets of polythene to dry and resell, a blind man sings mystic love songs. Other photographs reflect Dhaka's state of social and cultural flux, like an image of weary night-shift workers returning from a wholesale market in the late morning or of the barely visible lights of a pick-up truck concealed to prevent theft. Chowdhury is one of South Asia's most renowned architects, and Dhaka -- Memories or Lost constitutes his deeply personal tribute to the city.","DHAKA MEMORIES OR LOST KASHEF CHOWDHURY","","English"

It begins with an introduction to the history and science of photography and addresses questions about the principles of photography, such as why a camera needs a lens, how lenses work, and why modern lenses are so complicated. Digital photography raises more questions because enlarged images on computer screens reveal defects in color and resolution that are not obvious in small snapshots. What limits resolution, what is noise in images, and what level of detail can be appreciated by an observer? All of these questions and others concerning human perception of color and subjective image quality are covered in detail. Finally, the creation and appreciation of art in photography is presented from the standpoint of modern cognitive science.","SCIENCE FOR THE CURIOUS PHOTOGRAPHER AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIE","Johnson, Jr., Charles S.","English"

The book argues the strong and sustained influence, not only of the classic gothic novel itself - Ann Radcliffe, Charles Maturin, Matthew Lewis, etc. - but also the determinative impact of closely related phenomena, as with the influence of mediumism, alchemy and magic. The book also traces the later development of the gothic novel, as with Bram Stoker's Dracula, and its mutation into such works of popular fiction as the Fantômas series of Marcel Allain and Pierre Souvestre, enthusiastically taken up by writers such as Apollinaire and subsequently feeding into the development of surrealism. More broadly, the book considers a range of motifs strongly associated with gothic writing, as with insanity, incarceration and the 'accursed outsider', explored in relation to the personal experience and electroshock treatment of Antonin Artaud. A recurring motif of the analysis is that of the gothic castle, developed in the writings of Andre Breton, Artaud, Sade, Julien Gracq and other writers, as well as in the work of visual artists such as Magritte.","SURREALISM AND THE GOTHIC CASTLES OF THE INTERIOR","Matheson, Neil",""

In this book, Lucy Hartley identifies a new language for speaking about beauty, which begins to be articulated from the 1830s in a climate of political reform and becomes linked to emerging ideals of equality, liberty, and individuality. Examining British art and art writing by Charles Lock Eastlake, John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Edward Poynter, William Morris, and John Addington Symonds, Hartley traces a debate about what it means to be interested in beauty and whether this preoccupation is necessary to public political life. Drawing together political history, art history, and theories of society, and supplemented by numerous illustrations, Democratising Beauty in Nineteenth-Century Britain offers a fresh interdisciplinary understanding of the relation of art to its publics.","DEMOCRATISING BEAUTY IN NINETEENTH CENTURY BRITAIN","",""

This exemplifies a uniquely ambiguous colonial condition in which the interests of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were in constant flux. German capitalists and cultural figures sought influence in the Near East, including access to archaeological sites such as Tell Halaf and Mshatta. At the same time, Ottoman leaders and laborers urgently pursued imperial consolidation. Germany and the Ottoman Railways explores the impact of these political agendas as well as the railways' impact on the built environment. Relying on a trove of previously unpublished archival materials, including maps, plans, watercolors, and photographs, author Peter H. Christensen also reveals the significance of this major infrastructure project for the budding disciplines of geography, topography, art history, and archaeology.","GERMANY AND THE OTTOMAN RAILWAYS ART EMPIRE AND INFRASTRUCTURE","Christensen, Peter H.",""

In literature, film, art and popular culture, urban landscapes have been submerged by floods, razed by alien invaders, abandoned by fearful inhabitants and consumed in fire. The Dead City unearths meanings from such depictions of ruination and decay, looking at representations of both thriving cities and ones which are struggling, abandoned or simply in transition. It reveals that ruination presents a complex opportunity to envision new futures for a city, whether that is by rewriting its past or throwing off old assumptions and proposing radical change. Seen in a certain light, for example, urban ruin and decay are a challenge to capitalist narratives of unbounded progress. They can equally imply that power structures thought to be deeply ingrained are temporary, contingent and even fragile. Examining ruins in Chernobyl, Detroit, London, Manchester and Varosha, this book demonstrates that how we discuss and depict urban decline is intimately connected to the histories, economic forces, power structures and communities of a given city, as well as to conflicting visions for its future.","DEAD CITY URBAN RUINS AND THE SPECTACLE OF DECAY","Dobraszczyk, Paul","English"

Maligned, misunderstood and fetishized the 1980's stands as the decade when post-modern life began in the west, and London was at the epicenter of this shift. An explosion of creativity took place against a backdrop of radical social change. London became a city of tribes. The vast youth culture categories of the preceding decades shattered into shards. It was the decade that sub-culture as a way of life reached it's zenith before giving way to it's inevitable scene surfing conclusion. Ridgers documented this cultural moment obsessively. Punks, post-punks, cyber-punks, gothic punks, mods, hard mods, Trojan skins, racist skins, ska, reggae, dub, early electronica, synth pop, acid house, happy hardcore, Blitz Kids, New Romantics, Hip-Hop, Rap, Electro, Break Beat, Techno, Rave - these were all sub-cultural spaces with scenes attached in London in the 1980's. Unlike now, subcultures in the 1980's were not casual playthings - they were a way of life for their participants. They inspired profound loyalty. They were a beautiful a doomed flowering of the hope for a better world.

With insightful text and abundant imagery, this book reveals the hidden order of stone gardens and in the process heightens the enthusiast's appreciation of them. The Japanese stone garden is an art form recognized around the globe. These meditative gardens provide tranquil settings, where visitors can shed the burdens and stresses of modern existence, satisfy an age-old yearning for solitude and repose, and experience the restorative power of art and nature. For this reason, the value of the Japanese stone garden today is arguably even greater than when many of them were created. Fifteen gardens are featured in this book: some well known, such as the famous temple gardens of Kyoto, others less so, among them gardens spread through the south of Honshu Island and the southern islands of Shikoku and Kyushu and in faraway Okinawa.","JAPANESE STONE GARDENS ORIGINS MEANING & FORM","Mansfield, Stephen","English"

The work primarily catalogues the couple's illustration work, in which Alejandro Jodorowsky provides the lines and Pascale Montandon-Jodorowsky the color. The vibrant universe they create brims with ancestral myths, contemporary tales and metaphysical reflections on life; it is peopled by angels, clowns, mystical lovers and dream beings. In addition to cataloguing their illustrations, the volume includes movie stills from the pair's film work (they provided the color for Jodorowsky's recent The Dance of Reality and Endless Poetry), as well as various essays and interviews with the artists by Klaus Biesenbach and Hans Ulrich Obrist.","ALEJANDRO JODOROWSKY & PASCALE MONTANDON JODOROWSKY PASCALEJANDR","Jodorowsky, Alejandro",""

Publisher's description: The Museum of Capitalism in Oakland, California, treats capitalism as a historical phenomenon. This speculative institution views the present and recent past from the implied perspective of a future society in which our economic and political system is memorialized, and subjected to the museological gaze. Sketches and renderings of exhibits and artifacts, combined with relevant quotations from historical sources, are interspersed with speculative essays on the intersections of ecology, race, museology, historiography, economics and politics. Included are representations of artworks and museum exhibits created by artists Oliver Ressler, Sayler/Morris, Dread Scott, Temporary Services, and others, original Isotype graphics drawn from the museum's lexicon of ""capitalisms,"" and texts from Lucy Lippard, Lester K. Spence, T.J. Demos, Chantal Mouffe, McKenzie Wark and Kim Stanley Robinson, among others.","MUSEUM OF CAPITALISM","Steves, Andrea",""
