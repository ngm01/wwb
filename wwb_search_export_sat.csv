Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), the Beatles -- at that point the most famous band in the world -- found themselves increasingly drawn to Eastern mysticism, culminating with the band's 1968 trip to India (accompanied, of course, by wives and girlfriends as well as an entourage of friends, assistants and reporters). The journey that John, Paul, George and Ringo made to study at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram would become a key event in the history of Western pop culture: followed breathlessly in the international media, it caused an enormous stir and was fundamental in spreading a certain fascination with the East that influenced music, literature, cinema and fashion at the end of the 1960s. Nothing Is Real takes its title from a memorable line from the Beatles' song ""Strawberry Fields Forever."" Eastern thinking and spiritual practices felt liberating and modern to a generation looking for alternatives, and the Beatles' trip was a watershed moment, announcing definitively that Europe and the United States had a genuine trend on its hands.","NOTHING IS REAL WHEN THE BEATLES MET THE EAST","Beatrice, Luca","English, Italian"

What emerges from his meticulous investigation is an urban fabric surprisingly makeshift in its domestic sector yet exuberantly creative in its ecclesiastical architecture. Rather than viewing the city as a mere shadow of its ancient past, Bouras demonstrates how Athens remained an important city of the Byzantine Empire as the seat of a metropolitan, home to local aristocracy, and pilgrimage destination for those who came to worship at the Christian Parthenon. Byzantine Athens explores the relationship of the Byzantine infrastructure to earlier configurations, shedding light on the water supply, industrial facilities, streets and fortifications of medieval Athens, and exploring the evidence for the form and typology of Byzantine houses. Thanks to Bouras's indefatigable study of all available archaeological reports the first part of the book offers an overall picture of the Middle Byzantine city. This new English-language edition includes revisions and new material.","BYZANTINE ATHENS 10TH 12TH CENTURIES","Bouras, Charalambos","English"

The majority of the world's populations live in countries where clean water supplies are dwindling, and these water shortages are also quickly translating into food shortages. What can designers do to avert looming water-related realities? UrbanLab: Bowling views potential water crises as opportunities to speculate on future urban design possibilities, especially in cities. Several projects are presented that take an ecological approach to re-thinking received urban design methodologies of addressing the design of water-related infrastructures in existing and new cities.","BOWLING WATER ARCHITECTURE URBANISM URBANLAB","Dunn, Sarah","English"

Notorious bad boy of Italian painting, the artist was at once celebrated and controversial: violent in temper, precise in technique, a creative master, and a man on the run. Today, he is considered one of the greatest influences in all art history. This Bibliotheca Universalis edition offers a neat yet comprehensive Caravaggio catalogue raisonne. Each of his paintings is reproduced from recent top-quality photography, allowing for a vivid encounter with the artist's ingenious repertoire of looks and gestures, as well as numerous detail shots of his boundary-breaking naturalism, whether a grubby foot or the soft folds of a sagging stomach. Five accompanying chapters trace the complete arc of Caravaggio's career from his first public commissions in Rome through to his growing celebrity status, while the book's detailed chronology traces his tempestuous personal life, in which drama loomed as prominently as in his chiaroscuro canvases.","CARAVAGGIO THE COMPLETE WORKS","Schutze, Sebastian","English"

Yet the study of medieval art and visualities has, in general, remained Eurocentric in its canon and conservative in its approaches. 'Postcolonising', as the eleven essays in this volume show, entails active intervention into the field of medieval art history and visual studies through a theoretical reframing of research. This approach poses and elicits new research questions, and tests how concepts current in postcolonial studies - such as diaspora and migration, under-represented artistic cultures, accented art making, displacement, intercultural versus transcultural, hybridity, presence/absence - can help medievalists to reinvigorate the study of art and visuality. Postcolonial concepts are deployed in order to redraft the canon of medieval art, thereby seeking to build bridges between medievalist and modernist communities of scholars.","POSTCOLONISING THE MEDIEVAL IMAGE","Frojmovic, Eva","English"
