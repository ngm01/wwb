Gibney tells a story that has never been told so comprehensively before. What kind of contracts bound those involved? How much did it cost to bring a cargo of oak to the Dublin docks from Riga or Shillelagh (or fir from Trondheim) and what kind of roof trusses or floor framing was it used for? What was distinctively Irish about these structural features? What did plumbers do? How did roofers choose between slates and shingles and pantiles, and how did this choice affect the profile of a roof? Based on extensive documentary research and on a lifetime of experience of building and conservation, Gibney takes the interested layperson, the student, the architect, and the conservationist behind the facades to give us an understanding of paint colors-such as Venetian red and Spanish brown-the manufacture of stucco, the variations of Irish, English, and French glass, the composition of masonry walls, and much more in our great legacy of Georgian buildings.","BUILDING SITE IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IRELAND","Gibney, Arthur","English"

The volume argues that Beckett is more than an influence on contemporary art -- he is, in fact, a contemporary artist, working alongside artists across disciplines in the 1960s, 1970s, and beyond. The volume explores Beckett's formal experiments in drama, prose, and other media as contemporary, parallel revisions of modernism's theoretical presuppositions congruent with trends like minimalism and conceptual art. Containing interviews with and pieces by working artists, alongside contributions of scholars of literature and the visual arts, this collection offers an essential reassessment of Beckett's work. Perceiving Beckett's ongoing importance from the perspective of contemporary art practices, dominated by installation and conceptual strategies, it offers a completely new frame through which to read perennial Beckettian themes of impotence, failure, and penury. From Beckett's remains, as it were, contemporary artists find endless inspiration.","SAMUEL BECKETT AND CONTEMPORARY ART","Reginio, Robert","English"

Focused on the modernist networks surrounding Le Corbusier, the Salon des Realites Nouvelles, Groupe Espace, as well as on more radical neo-avant-garde groups such as the Situationist International, this book casts new light on various artistic collaborations amidst the French rebuilding efforts. It asks a series of critical questions such as, how did the synthesis of the arts discourse lead to a rethinking of the aesthetics of public space in postwar France? And how did it participate in the physical reconstruction and modernization of French towns? Finally, it investigates how the avant-garde language of abstraction and polychromy can be re-envisioned in the context of advanced capitalism, and the ways in which it was complicit, and resistant, to various governmental, corporate and industrial projects.","","Pezolet, Nicola",""

Publisher's description: Urban biodiversity is an increasingly popular topic among researchers. Worldwide, thousands of research projects are unravelling how urbanisation impacts the biodiversity of cities and towns, as well as its benefits for people and the environment through ecosystem services. Exciting scientific discoveries are made on a daily basis. However, researchers often lack time and opportunity to communicate these findings to the community and those in charge of managing, planning and designing for urban biodiversity. On the other hand, urban practitioners frequently ask researchers for more comprehensible information and actionable tools to guide their actions based on more objective scientific bases. This book is designed to fill this cultural and communicative gap by discussing a selection of topics related to urban biodiversity, as well as its benefits for people and the urban environment. It provides an interdisciplinary overview of scientifically-grounded knowledge vital for current and future practitioners in charge of urban biodiversity management, its conservation and integration into urban planning.","URBAN BIODIVERSITY FROM RESEARCH TO PRACTICE","Ossola, Alessandro",""

In 1787, the minion of Catherine the Great purportedly had entire villages erected as painted façades along the paths of her travels to the recently conquered Crimean territory in an effort to veil the true, run-down face of the region. Following Closed Cities (Kehrer 2012), Gregor Sailer's new project once again presents actual architectural manifestations driven by political, military, and economic motives: combat training centers in the USA and Europe, faithful replicas of European cities in China, and vehicle test cities in Sweden. And finally, a classical Potemkin village in Russia, where, on the occasion of a visit by Vladimir Putin to Suzdal on the Golden Ring and a triple summit in the city of Ufa, whole streets were masked with adhesive foil, wallpaper, and tarpaulins in an effort to provide the abandoned buildings with a feigned sense of activity. Sailer's pictures give the viewer access to the world of fakes, copies, and stage sets and call these at times absurd aberrations of our contemporary society into question.","POTEMKIN VILLAGE GREGOR SAILER","",""

Publisher's description: 'On the eve of the election, when nothing had yet been decided, when everything -- whatever that everything was -- hung in the balance, Eggleston made an elegy ... a statement of perfect calm.' -- Lloyd Fonvielle. In 1977 William Eggleston released Election Eve, his first and most elaborate artist's book, containing 100 original prints in two leatherbound volumes, housed in a linen box. It was published by Caldecot Chubb in New York in an edition of only five, and has since become Eggleston's rarest collectible book. This new Steidl edition recreates the full original sequence of photos in a single volume, making it available to the wider public for the first time. Election Eve contains images made in October 1976 during Eggleston's pilgrimage from Memphis to the small town of Plains, Georgia, the home of Jimmy Carter who in November 1976 was elected 39th President of the United States. Eggleston began photographing even before he left Memphis and depicted the surrounding countryside and villages of Sumter Country, before he reached Plains.","ELECTION EVE WILLIAM EGGLESTON","","English"
