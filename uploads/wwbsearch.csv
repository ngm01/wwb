Note: the publisher produced an alternate edition of this publication for Pace Gallery in New York to accompany their related exhibition mounted in 2014; although the trade edition offered by Worldwide omits certain exhibition references included in the Pace edition, the two versions are otherwise identical. Publisher's description: ""Hiroshi Sugimoto (born 1948) began his four-decade-long series Dioramas in 1974, inspired by a trip to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Surrounded by the museum's elaborate, naturalistic dioramas, Sugimoto realized that the scenes jumped to life when looked at with one eye closed. Focusing his camera on individual dioramas as though they were entirely surrounding scenes, omitting their frames and educational materials and ensuring that no reflections enter the shot, his subjects appear as if photographed in their natural habitats. He also explores the power of photography to create history -- in his own words, ""photography functions as a fossilization of time.""","HIROSHI SUGIMOTO DIORAMAS","","English"

This revised and expanded second edition provides an overview of various traditional garments, introduces types of designs found in twentieth century kimono that are still available, and presents wearable art and home decor inspired by kimono from contemporary artists. Because wearing kimono is diminishing and kimono are disappearing from Japanese wardrobes, they will become increasingly collectible. Each of the fourteen chapters opens with the definition of the type of apparel covered including everyday, formal, etc., as well as their use in Japanese life. The terms are further explained in the glossary. Over 525 color photographs display brilliant and subtle textile designs and demonstrate beauty in men's, women's, and children's garments and accessories. Textile and clothing designers will find a wealth of inspiration here, as well as vintage clothing enthusiasts and those who wish to wear kimono traditionally.","KIMONO VANISHING TRADITION JAPANESE TEXTILES OF THE 20TH CENTURY","Imperatore, Cheryl","English"
