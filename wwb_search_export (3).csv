Posters and prints circulated across the city, as the new art form of cinema flourished, all part of a diverse urban climate of leisure that was particularly French. These rich visual materials served to promote the careers and talents of such celebrities as Jane Avril, Loie Fuller, and Sarah Bernhardt. Alphonse Mucha and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec developed the potential of color lithography to meet the demands of these stars, while fine artists ranging from Edgar Degas and Edouard Manet to Pablo Picasso and Edouard Vuillard focused on such spectacles as the racetrack, ballet, cafe-concert, theater, and opera, asserting them as defining elements of Parisian modernity in this image-saturated milieu.",SPECTACLE AND LEISURE IN PARIS DEGAS TO MUCHA,"Childs, Elizabeth C.",English

Before Kirk Hammett assumed the heavy metal mantle of one of the most successful and beloved bands in rock history, he was a geek for the imaginative universe of horror. This generously illustrated book highlights the finest examples from Hammett's personal collection -- an astonishing trove of horror and sci-fi film posters that span the history of the genre. The guitarist credits his musical force to a lifelong fascination with the gothic fantasy developed in these films and their original posters. In this volume, several intriguing essays cover the history of the film poster, the brain's response to fear, and Hammett's own contributions to the world of the macabre.",IT S ALIVE CLASSIC HORROR AND SCI FI MOVIE POSTERS FROM THE KIRK,"Finamore, Daniel",English

Taking its lead from W.H. Hunt's watercolor The Head Gardener, c. 1825, that is part of The Courtauld Gallery's permanent collection, this focused display will be first to investigate Hunt's depiction of rural figures in his work of the 1820s and 1830s. Consisting of twenty drawings borrowed from collections across the United Kingdom, William Henry Hunt: Country People will bring together watercolors depicting country people in their working or living environments, from farmer and gamekeeper to stonebreaker and gleaner. The representation of these country men, women and children, closely observed, raises questions about their status and way of life at a time of rapid agricultural and social change. These profound changes are also reflected in the literature of the period. William Henry Hunt was one of the most admired watercolorists of the 19th century. Better known as 'Bird's Nest Hunt' for his intricate still lives of flowers, fruit and birds' eggs, he exhibited prolifically at the Old Water Colour Society. His works were sought after by collectors, notably John Ruskin, a serious champion of his work.'",WILLIAM HENRY HUNT COUNTRY PEOPLE,"Selbourne, Joanna",English

Built between about 850 and 1150, Khajuraho is renowned as much for the elegance of its architecture as for the sensuality of its sculpture. Once an important political and religious center, it is thought to have contained up to 95 Hindu and Jain temples, but today, only 25 survive -- many with stunning depictions of human sexuality. The area has undergone restoration since being rediscovered in the early 19th century, and today is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

YEEZY Season 3-4 Zine is an incredible object, printed in an oversized format on rough, uncoated Kamiko paper with intensely black inks.
