Working largely outside the confines of the gallery and museum world, Heizer has redefined sculpture in terms of size, mass, gesture, and process. Heizer's work City, an enormous complex in the rural desert of Lincoln County, Nevada, was recently designated Federally Protected Land. He draws on both ancient and contemporary architecture and art, cultivating tons of materials, including dirt, rock, and steel, in his quest to create a ""permanent American art."" This book, which features beautiful images of rarely or never-before-seen early paintings, the Altar series of new monumental steel sculptures, and negative wall sculptures of metamorphic and igneous rocks, serves to illustrate this quest.",MICHAEL HEIZER ALTARS,"Fine, Ruth",English

American painter Joe Bradley has distinguished himself among the artists of his generation with his mutable approach to art-making. With minimal fuss, Bradley works in series, picking up and discarding styles and oscillating between abstraction and figuration as it suits him. ""A retrospective of his work would look like a group show,"" wrote dealer and collector Kenny Schachter. Bradley's first large-scale North American exhibition supports this observation: he is shown moving from expressionistic canvases that record the detritus and spontaneity of the studio environment to subtly figurative send-ups of Minimalist painting, then to starkly primitivistic glyphs drawn in grease pencil on unprimed canvas, followed by modular aluminum sculptures paired with textual directives. This richly illustrated catalog, published to accompany Bradley's midcareer survey organized by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, presents the full range of Bradley's unique approach to language, abstraction and the evolutions of style.",JOE BRADLEY,"Siren, Janne",English

In the 1930s, Kurt Schwitters constructed his famous three-dimensional collage Merzbau. Since then, paper has become an indispensable material in sculptural works. And yet there is no real ""tradition"" of paper sculpture. Rather, paper appears as a working material whenever artists break with tradition. Gigantic works by Charlotte Posenenske resemble industrial components and serve as caricatures of the monumental aspects of 19th-century sculpture. Erwin Heerich's cardboard pieces, constructed according to mathematical schemata, can be enlarged and turned into buildings. Meanwhile Dieter Roth attacked any notions of timelessness or eternal validity with his ""literature sausages"" by pressing softened books and magazines into sausage casings, turning them into sculptural objects. Other artists featured in this book include Karla Black, Dan Flavin, Raymond Hains, Thomas Hirschhorn, Isamu Noguchi, Robert Rauschenberg, Jacques de la Villegle and Wolf Vostell.",SCULPTURES MADE OF PAPER,"Gundel, Marc","English, German"

Mark Bradford's exhibition for the US Pavilion at the 2017 Venice Biennale, titled Tomorrow Is Another Day, is born out of the artist's longtime commitment to the inherently social nature of the material world. For Bradford, abstraction is not opposed to content; it embodies it. Finding materials for his paintings in the hair salon, Home Depot and the streets of Los Angeles, Bradford renews the traditions of abstract painting, demonstrating that freedom from socially prescribed representation is profoundly meaningful in the hands of a black artist. Mark Bradford: Tomorrow Is Another Day is not only a catalog for Bradford's pavilion project; it is a different kind of book, a substantial publication that blends the biographical with the historical and political. Essays from outside the art world -- by Anita Hill, Peter James Hudson, W.E.B. Du Bois and Zadie Smith -- narrate a series of interwoven stories about Reconstruction, civil rights and the vulnerable body in urban space, fleshed out with vivid archival photographs and documents.",MARK BRADFORD TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY,"Bedford, Christopher",English

Recently the artist created ""Sandbox,"" a new installation in which she combines elements from her work from the 1960s to the present. A picture essay by Joan Banach, artist and friend of Bontecou, focuses on the genesis of ""Sandbox"" and maps the rich network of Bontecou's inspirations: pictures range from extracts from geological and historical books to images of works by old masters.

In 1943, after being asked by his daughter why she couldn't immediately see the photograph he had just taken, American inventor and scientist Edwin H. Land conceived of the technology required to make this seemingly impossible demand a reality -- within an hour. Land's creation was a groundbreaking scientific accomplishment that also heralded an exciting new chapter of artistic expression. Through the efforts of thousands of photographers the world over, as well as the corporation's own artist support program, which provided many with materials, Polaroid would help shape the artistic landscape of the late twentieth century. Published to accompany a major traveling exhibition,ÿThe Polaroid Projectÿis a creative exploration of the relationship between Polaroid's many technological innovations and the art that was created with their help. Richly designed with over 300 illustrations, this impressive volume showcases not only the myriad and often idiosyncratic approaches taken by such photographers as Ansel Adams, Robert Mapplethorpe, Ellen Carey, and Chuck Close, but also a fascinating selection of the technical objects and artifacts that speak to the sheer ingenuity that lay behind the art.",POLAROID PROJECT AT THE INTERSECTION OF ART AND TECHNOLOGY,"Ewing, William A.",English
